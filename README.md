 ## Log of What's been done:
 - 2019-05-15:
   - read a lot of the spree commerce documentation. Looking through
     the generated source code and trying to decide if I'm going to edit the
     sample site or create something from scratch. Leaning towards editing the
     sample site; so much of the work is already done for me!
   - found some good resources with which to move forward, mainly:
     - [Spree view customizatoin](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/customization/view.html)
     - [Spree preferences](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/core/preferences.html#configuring-spree-preferences)

 ## Notes:
 * potential colorscheme: https://coolors.co/b34b43-ffee56-51a3a3-484a47-a6afb1
 * why do I like PHP?
   * do everything yourself, therefore you know how it works
   * I have the most experience with it; I am comfortable putting together a
     database, php backend, and javascript frontend.
   * easier to understand why something doesn't work
 * why do I like Ruby on Rails?
   * less work for complex features
   * standard that makes development easier if I ever pass off development
 * gonna stick with RoR for now.... I'll just find a way to do more of the work
   instead of using plugins so I understand how it works
