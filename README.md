## Dependencies:

## TODO:
 - [ ] Styling! Look at spree view customization: https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/customization/view.html
 - [ ] Figure out how to get SASS styling applied
 - [ ] make homepage look something like Em's draft
 - [ ] what pages does Em want?

 ## Notes:
 * potential colorscheme: https://coolors.co/b34b43-ffee56-51a3a3-484a47-a6afb1
 * why do I like PHP?
   * do everything yourself, therefore you know how it works
   * I have the most experience with it; I am comfortable putting together a
     database, php backend, and javascript frontend.
   * easier to understand why something doesn't work
 * why do I like Ruby on Rails?
   * less work for complex features
   * standard that makes development easier if I ever pass off development
 * gonna stick with RoR for now.... I'll just find a way to do more of the work
   instead of using plugins so I understand how it works
