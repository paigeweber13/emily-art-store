## Log of What's been done:
 - 2019-05-15:
   - read a lot of the spree commerce documentation. Looking through
     the generated source code and trying to decide if I'm going to edit the
     sample site or create something from scratch. Leaning towards editing the
     sample site; so much of the work is already done for me!
   - found some good resources with which to move forward, mainly:
     - [Spree view customizatoin](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/customization/view.html)
     - [Spree preferences](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/core/preferences.html#configuring-spree-preferences)
