# Sprint 1
## Target Release Date: 2019-05-26
## Goals:
 - [ ] choose tools
 - [ ] learn to use tools
 - [ ] basic homepage with dummy products and custom styling

## Stretch:
 - [ ] product page
 - [ ] plan site layout, user flow

## Plan:
 * 5-23: 
   * look deeper at payment platforms, tutorials, plan architecture
   * Do I want spree? Or my own in-house thing?
   * Also, ask em if she has a preference: I build everything from the 
     ground up or we use something like spree and try to extend it.
 * 5-24: rapid fire through some tutorials? Or just skip to building Em's
 * 5-25: customize it for Em

## Log of What's been done:
 - 2019-05-15:
   - read a lot of the spree commerce documentation. Looking through
     the generated source code and trying to decide if I'm going to edit the
     sample site or create something from scratch. Leaning towards editing the
     sample site; so much of the work is already done for me!
   - found some good resources with which to move forward, mainly:
     - [Spree view customizatoin](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/customization/view.html)
     - [Spree preferences](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/core/preferences.html#configuring-spree-preferences)
